*Most of this comes from Dan Abramov's free [Getting Started with Redux course on egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)*

Redux is a small library that provides convenient functions to store *application state* in a single object.

This is better than storing application state in individual React components, because it's easier to debug and test ("you hit a weird edge case? Let's just copy your state object and write a test against that weird state."), makes things like [time travel debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs) and [undo/redo](https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo) easier, gives you [some sick devtools to inspect your app with](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd), and provides a clearer structure for building complicated apps.

For example, the state of this app:

![](https://i.imgur.com/M9JpK65.png)

could be represented by this single object

```javascript
const state = {
  filter: "ACTIVE",
  todos: [
    {
      id: 0,
      completed: false,
      text: "milk"
    },
    {
      id: 1,
      completed: false,
      text: "cookies"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      completed: false,
      text: "eggs"
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      completed: true,
      text: "kale"
    }
  ]
}
```

From this state, it's super clear what would need to happen to make any change to the app:

* show only completed tasks? `state.filter = "COMPLETED"`
* change "eggs" to "organic eggs"? `state.todos.find(todo => todo.id === 2).text = "organic eggs"`
* delete "cookies"? `state.todos = state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== 1)`

Anything your app renders now becomes a game of taking a single object and turning it into UI. Anything your app does now becomes a game of changing the correct piece of state.

## Actions and Reducers

Instead of modifying the state directly (`state.filter = "COMPLETED"`), redux prescribes the more scalable solution of **dispatching actions** that get fed to **reducers** that do the actual modifying.

### Actions

An action to change the filter to "COMPLETED" may look like:

```javascript
const action = {
  type: "SET_FILTER",
  payload: {
    filter: "COMPLETED"
  }
}
```

*Note: putting `filter` under `payload` instead of at the root of this action object follows the [flux standard action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) guidelines*

An action to add a todo may look like:

```javascript
const action = {
  type: "ADD_TODO",
  payload: {
    text: "sausage",
    id: 5,
    completed: false
  }
}
```

### Reducers

A Redux Reducer is a function that receives the app's current state and an action and returns a new state modified by that action.

Here's a reducer that could handle the `SET_FILTER` action above:

```javascript
const filterReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  if(action.type === "SET_FILTER"){
    const newState = {...state};
    newState.filter = action.payload.filter;
    return newState;
  }
  return state;
}
```

and another that could handle the `ADD_TODO` action:

```javascript
const todosReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  if(action.type === "ADD_TODO"){
    const newState = {...state};
    newState.todos = [...newState.todos, action.payload];
    return newState;
  }
  return state;
}
```

and another that could handle both actions:

```javascript
const rootReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "ADD_TODO":
      const newTodos = [...state.todos, action.payload];
      return {...state, todos: newTodos};
    case "SET_FILTER":
      return {...state, filter: action.payload.filter};
    default: return state;
  }
}
```

#### CombineReducers

Using the [shorthand combineReducers function](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/UsingCombineReducers.html) produces an identical reducer in a more composable way:

```javascript
// name this reducer with "Reducer" in the name
const todosReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "ADD_TODO": return [...state.todos, action.payload];
    default: return state;
  }
}

// this reducer has the same name as its key in state
const filter = (state = "", action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "SET_FILTER": return action.payload.filter;
    default: return state;
  }
}

// combineReducers makes reducers more composable
const rootReducer = combineReducers(({
  todos: todosReducer,
  filter // cleaner
}));
```

Here's a minimalistic implementation of `combineReducers`:

```javascript
const combineReducers = (reducers) => {
  return (state = {}, action) => {
    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce(
      (nextState, key) => {
        nextState[key] = reducers[key](
          state[key],
          action
        );
        return nextState;
      },
      {}
    );
  };
};
```

### Reducer Best Practices

It's important that reducers are [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) (functions that don't have side effects like modifying their inputs and always return the same result with the same input).

It's also important that if the reducer receives an action it doesn't know how to handle, it returns the untouched state. This makes reducers *composable*: multiple reducers can be combined and called in series.

Another trick is to provide a default state value so that if the reducer is called with a null state it will return a workable state.

### Why not just modify the state directly?

The advantages of using actions and reducers instead of modifying that `state` directly are that:

1. `state` is read only, which makes it easier to debug and build tools on top of (that's how [redux-devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) is possible)
2. dispatching an action doesn't require that you know *how* the state will be modified. You could change how the underlying state is structured:

```javascript
const state = {
  filter: "ACTIVE",
  todos: {
    "0": {
      completed: false,
      text: "milk"
    },
    "2": {
      completed: false,
      text: "eggs"
    },
    "3": {
      completed: true,
      text: "kale"
    }
  }
}
```

and how your reducers change the state:

```javascript

```

but your action dispatchers wouldn't need to change.

## Store

A redux store:

1. holds the `state`
2. holds your reducers
2. accepts actions and dispatches them through your reducers

Here's an example of how to create a store with [`createStore`](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/createStore.html) that holds a simple integer state and a simple increment/decrement reducer:

```javascript
import { createStore } from "redux";

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "INCREMENT": return state + 1;
    case "DECREMENT": return state - 1;
    default: return state;
  }
}

const initialState = 10;

// create a store with an optional initial state
const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);

// get the store's state
store.getState();
// listen for changes to state
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
  // I'm not sure why state isn't given as an argument to this callback
  console.dir(store.getState());
})

// dispatch an INCREMENT action
store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });

// now...
store.getState() === 11
```

### Simple `createStore` implementation

```javascript
const createStore = (reducer, initialState) => {
  let state = initialState;
  let listeners = [];

  const getState = () => state;

  const dispatch = (action) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
  };

  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    // return an unsubscribe function
    return () => {
      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
    };
  };

  dispatch({});

  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };
};
```

### Enhancers

`Redux.createStore` also accepts an optional `enhancer`.

# React Redux

Redux was created with React in mind, so they work super well together.

Assuming you have a redux `store` object available (from `createStore`), a simple React+Redux integration could look like this:

```
// Counter is a dumb presentational component that doens't care about redux
const Counter = ({
  value,
  onIncrement,
  onDecrement
}) => (
  <div>
    <h1>{value}</h1>
    <button onClick={onIncrement}>+</button>
    <button onClick={onDecrement}>-</button>
  </div>
);

// render is a smart container component that connects Counter to redux
const render = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Counter
      // get state from the store
      value={store.getState()}

      // onIncrement and onDecrement, dispatch a redux action
      onIncrement={() => store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})}
      onDecrement={() => store.dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT'})}
    />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
};

// re-render if the redux store's state changes
store.subscribe(render);
render();
```

Dispatching actions on a global `store` object (as in this example) doesn't scale very well (global variables encourage [spaghetti code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code)). You could pass `store` as a prop down through every component, but that would be super annoying.

To fix this annoyance, Dan Abramov made a package called [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) to help bind React components to redux.

## `<Provider store>`

Wrap your entire app in a `Provider` component so any descendant can pull out a piece of the store it wants:

```
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <Router history={history}>
      <Route path="/" component={App}>
        <Route path="foo" component={Foo}/>
        <Route path="bar" component={Bar}/>
      </Route>
    </Router>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

`Provider` will now pass `store` down through React's [`context`](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html), so any descendant of `Provider` can access `this.context.store`.

> [Provider] magically make[s] the store available to all container components in the application without passing [the store] explicitly

## `connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)`

Every descendant having access to the entire store is a bad practice. It's much cleaner to only give components exactly what they actually need.

Also, `context` "is an experimental API and it is likely to break in future releases of React", so you probably shouldn't use it.

`connect` addresses these bad options by wrapping dump React presentational components in a new smart container component that feeds the dumb component only what the dumb component needs from the redux store.

> Technically, a [connect] container component is just a React component that uses store.subscribe() to read a part of the Redux state tree and supply props to a presentational component it renders...[connect] provides many useful optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders [so] you shouldn't have to worry about the React performance suggestion of implementing shouldComponentUpdate yourself.
> -- [Redux Usage with React](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html)

Connect is a higher order component - a function that returns another function, so calling it looks odd:

```javascript
import { connect } from 'react-redux'

const TodosContainerComponent = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(TodosPresentationalComponent)

export default TodosContainerComponent
```

### `mapStateToProps`

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  return {
    todos: getVisibleTodos(state.todos, state.visibilityFilter)
  }
}
```

### `mapDispatchToProps`

```javascript
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => {
  return {
    onClick: id => {
      dispatch(toggleTodo(id))
    }
  }
}
```
