Redux is a small library that provides convenient functions to store *application state* in a single immutable state object. This read-only single source of truth is never changed directly; it's mutated with pure functions called reducers.

Redux's convenient functions in order of relevancy to this guide are:

* [`createStore`](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/createStore.html): create an object to hold state and reducers and dispatch actions
* [`combineReducers`](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/combineReducers.html): turn an object holding keyspaced reducers into a single reducer function
* [`compose`](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/compose.html): `compose(f, g, h)(args) === f(g(h(args))) `
* [`applyMiddleware`](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/applyMiddleware.html): [monkeypatch `dispatch`](https://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html) to add things like logging, exception handling, action scheduling, dispatching functions with [redux thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk), and [dispatching promises in action payloads](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise)
* [`bindActionCreators`](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/bindActionCreators.html): ?

Following the [three principles of redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html) (single source of truth, read-only state, pure function mutations) offers several advantages:

* your app is easier to debug and test ("you hit a weird edge case? Let's just copy your state object and write a test against that weird state.")
* faster development cycles with [time travel debugging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs)
* features like [undo/redo](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ImplementingUndoHistory.html) and [server-side rendering](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/ServerRendering.html) go from impossible to trivial
* because mutations are centralized and are applied one by one, race condition bugs are much rarer
* you can use [some sick devtools to inspect your app with](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd)
* the higher level patterns of passing state down in one direction and dispatching actions that modify an application wide state result in a clearer structure for building complicated apps

For example, the state of this app:

![](https://i.imgur.com/M9JpK65.png)

could be represented by this single object

```javascript
const state = {
  filter: "ACTIVE",
  todos: [
    {
      id: 0,
      completed: false,
      text: "milk"
    },
    {
      id: 1,
      completed: false,
      text: "cookies"
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      completed: false,
      text: "eggs"
    },
    {
      id: 3,
      completed: true,
      text: "kale"
    }
  ]
}
```

From this state, it's super clear what would need to happen to make any change to the app:

* show only completed tasks? `state.filter = "COMPLETED"`
* change "eggs" to "organic eggs"? `state.todos.find(todo => todo.id === 2).text = "organic eggs"`
* delete "cookies"? `state.todos = state.todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== 1)`

Making your app render something is just a game of turning a piece of an immutable javascript object into UI. Making your app do something is just a game of mutating the correct piece of state.

## Actions and Reducers

Instead of modifying the state directly (`state.filter = "COMPLETED"`), redux prescribes the more scalable solution of **dispatching actions** that get fed to **reducers** that do the actual modifying.

### Actions

An action to change the filter to "COMPLETED" may look like:

```javascript
const action = {
  type: "SET_FILTER",
  payload: {
    filter: "COMPLETED"
  }
}
```

*Note: putting `filter` under `payload` instead of at the root of this action object follows the [flux standard action](https://github.com/acdlite/flux-standard-action) guidelines*

An action to add a todo may look like:

```javascript
const action = {
  type: "ADD_TODO",
  payload: {
    text: "sausage",
    id: 5,
    completed: false
  }
}
```

#### Action Creators

Action Creators make it easier to generate actions. For the above `ADD_TODO` action, an action creator may look like:

```javascript
const addTodo = todo => {
  return {
    type: "ADD_TODO",
    payload: todo
  }
}
```

Here's an example of how to dispatch an action created by this action creator:

```javascript
store.dispatch(addTodo({
  text: "almonds",
  id: 6,
  completed: false
}))
```

### Reducers

A Redux Reducer is a function that receives 1) the app's **current state** and 2) an **action**. Reducers return a **new state** modified by that action.

Reducers must be [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) (functions that don't have side effects like modifying their inputs and always return the same result with the same input). You can force yourself to make reducers pure functions by using a library like [Immutable.js](http://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), but you'll hit a lot of library incompatibility problems (ex: redux's native `combineReducers` - explained below - needs to be replaced with [a special redux-immutable library](https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable)). If you're starting out with redux, don't use an extra library.

If a reducer receives an action it doesn't know how to handle, it must return the untouched state. This makes reducers *composable*: multiple reducers can be combined and called in series.

If a reducer is called with a `null` or `undefined` `state`, it should provide a default state (which is easy to implement with [ES6 default function parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters)). This practice makes it easier for your app to start up.

Here's an example reducer that could modify the application state in response to the `SET_FILTER` action above:

```javascript
const filterReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  if(action.type === "SET_FILTER"){
    // make sure not to modify the original state
    const newState = {...state};
    newState.filter = action.payload.filter;
    return newState;
  }
  return state;
}
```

and another that could handle the `ADD_TODO` action:

```javascript
const todosReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  if(action.type === "ADD_TODO"){
    const newState = {...state};
    newState.todos = [...newState.todos, action.payload];
    return newState;
  }
  return state;
}
```

and another that could handle both actions:

```javascript
const rootReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "ADD_TODO":
      const newTodos = [...state.todos, action.payload];
      return {...state, todos: newTodos};
    case "SET_FILTER":
      return {...state, filter: action.payload.filter};
    default: return state;
  }
}
```

#### CombineReducers

Using the [shorthand combineReducers function](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/reducers/UsingCombineReducers.html) produces an identical reducer in a more composable way:

```javascript
// name this reducer with "Reducer" in the name
const todosReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "ADD_TODO": return [...state.todos, action.payload];
    default: return state;
  }
}

// this reducer has the same name as it's key in state
// this naming convention has an advantage you'll see below
const filter = (state = "", action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "SET_FILTER": return action.payload.filter;
    default: return state;
  }
}

// combineReducers makes reducers more composable
const rootReducer = combineReducers(({
  todos: todosReducer,
  filter // cleaner
}));
```

Here's a minimalistic implementation of `combineReducers`:

```javascript
const combineReducers = (reducers) => {
  return (state = {}, action) => {
    // return reduced reducers, lol
    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce(
      (nextState, key) => {
        nextState[key] = reducers[key](
          state[key],
          action
        );
        return nextState;
      },
      {}
    );
  };
};
```

The [redux-immutable](https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable) library's [modified `combineReducers`](https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable/blob/master/src/combineReducers.js) effectively just changes the second line to:

```javascript
  return (state = Immutable.Map, action)
```

### Why not just modify the state directly?

The advantages of using actions and reducers instead of modifying that `state` directly are that:

1. `state` is read only, which makes it easier to debug your apps and integrate tools (that's how [redux-devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) is possible)
2. dispatching an action doesn't require that you know *how* the state will be modified. You could change how the underlying state is structured:

```javascript
const state = {
  filter: "ACTIVE",
  todos: {
    "0": {
      completed: false,
      text: "milk"
    },
    "2": {
      completed: false,
      text: "eggs"
    },
    "3": {
      completed: true,
      text: "kale"
    }
  }
}
```

and how your reducers change the state:

```javascript
const todosReducer = (state = [], action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "ADD_TODO": return {...state.todos, [action.payload.id]: action.payload};
    default: return state;
  }
}
```

but your actions wouldn't need to change:

```javascript
const action = {
  type: "ADD_TODO",
  payload: {
    text: "sausage",
    id: 5,
    completed: false
  }
}
```

## Store

A redux store:

1. holds the `state`
2. holds your reducers
2. let's you `dispatch` `actions` through the reducers to modify the state

Here's an example of how to create a redux store with [`Redux.createStore`](https://redux.js.org/docs/api/createStore.html) that holds a simple integer state and a simple increment/decrement reducer:

```javascript
import { createStore } from "redux";

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch(action.type){
    case "INCREMENT": return state + 1;
    case "DECREMENT": return state - 1;
    default: return state;
  }
}

// create a store with an optional initial state
const initialState = 10;
const store = createStore(reducer, initialState);

// listen for changes to state
const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() => {
  // I'm not sure why state isn't given as an argument to this callback

  // get the updated state to re-render your UI
  console.dir(store.getState());
})

// dispatch an INCREMENT action, which triggers all subscriptions
store.dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" });

// after the above INCREMENT action, state is changed:
store.getState() === 11
```

### Simple `createStore` implementation

```javascript
const createStore = (reducer, initialState) => {
  let state = initialState;
  let listeners = [];

  const getState = () => state;

  const dispatch = (action) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
  };

  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    // return an unsubscribe function
    return () => {
      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
    };
  };

  dispatch({});

  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };
};
```

Compare this simple implementation with the [actual `Redux.createStore` implementation](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/blob/master/src/createStore.js), which adds **enhancers** and handles some weird edge cases.

### Enhancers

`Redux.createStore` also accepts an optional `enhancer`.
