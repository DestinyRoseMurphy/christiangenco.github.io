[Coding is a useful skill](/you-should-learn-to-program), even if you don't work as a programmer, because coding lets you to build tools that make anything you do easier.

After reading, writing, and understanding enough math to [know when you're getting cheated](https://sivers.org/prog), it's the most important skill you can learn.

The best way to get started is to start building stuff you want to exist. It's a win/win, because you're building your coding skills while building a useful thing for yourself, and it makes it very clear what the next thing to learn is.

Your goal should be to build lots of stuff. Lots of really crappy stuff at first, but knowing that it's okay that it's crappy, because it's going to get better the more stuff you build.

A similar idea from [Art and Fear](http://amzn.to/2jaqSzm):

> The ceramics teacher announced that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality.
>
> His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the "quantity" group: fifty pounds of pots rated an "A", forty pounds a "B", and so on. Those being graded on "quality", however, needed to produce only one pot — albeit a perfect one — to get an "A".
>
> Well, grading time came and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity!
>
> It seems that while the "quantity" group was busily churning out piles of work — and learning from their mistakes — the "quality" group had sat around theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay.

## How do I decide what projects to make?

**If you already have a project idea**, start by drawing out what you'd like the finished project to look like.

**If you don't have a project idea**,

**If your project idea is so good you want to raise funding and make a sexy silicon valley startup**,

## What language should I learn?

It doesn't matter as much as you think it does. Once you learn your first language, it's much easier to learn a second one, and easier than that to learn a third. Ask a professional programmer how many languages they know and most will lose count between 10 and 30.
