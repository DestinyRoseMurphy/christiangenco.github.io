At the first TEDxSMU event just for SMU students, I gave a talk on [the benefits of learning to program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_IodtNIG_o) - something I'm extremely passionate about.

The talk was extremely well received there, and I was invited to give it again at SMU's main TED conference, [TEDxSMU](http://www.tedxsmu.org/), on December 1st, and [TEDxKids](http://www.tedxsmu.org/tedxkids-smu-2012/) on November 30th.

Since then I've given talks at the opening of the Perot Museum, Highland Park High School, and Ursuline Academy's STEM day.

I'm in the process of writing a book on the topic (if you'd like an early copy, <a href="http://signup.youshouldlearntoprogram.com/">let me know</a>!), but in the meanwhile, here are some reasources I recommend for beginner programmers:
