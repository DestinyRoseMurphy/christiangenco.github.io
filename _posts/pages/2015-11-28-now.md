I read [a blog post by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) that talks about his idea to keep track of [what he's doing right now](https://sivers.org/now) on his website:

> It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused. A public declaration of priorities.
> (If I’m doing something that’s not on my list, is it something I want to add, or something I want to stop?)
> It helps me say no, too. When I decline invitations, I point them to [that page](https://sivers.org/now) to let them know it’s not personal.

That sounds like something that could help me! Here's what I'm focused on this month, and what I plan to focus on for the next few months:

## App pool

This is a list of apps I eventually want to make:

* S3 filesystem/archive
* f(t): Apple Watch/iOS timer for calculating things like how tall your building is based on how long it takes a pebble to fall to the ground
* 3D wedding band generator
* a better Mailchimp with tight Rails and Meteor integration
* a better Google Voice for businesses
* a timesheet you can clock in/out of with an app/sms
* make it easy for users to convert excel documents to strict json
* financial retirement tracker
* [markdown to mla](http://markdowntomla.com) native app
* native mac file tools (pdf merge, image resize, geotag strip, image flip from iOS bug)
* "Launching Rails" info product
