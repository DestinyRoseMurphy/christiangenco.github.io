[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a collection of tools (Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, Hosting, Authentication, Cloud Storage, and related analytics) that make it easier to build apps.

Hosting, Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Storage fit particularly well in my [opinionated app making decisions](/react-redux-firestore):

* I can statically deploy apps for free with built in custom domain SSL on [Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/). After configuration, deployments are a simple `$ firebase deploy` and scale at [$0.15/GB transferred](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) with a built in CDN and rollbacks. Fantastic - as long as the bill stays reasonable, I never have to think about the DevOps of hosting my apps again.
* I don't have to run through [OAuth authentication boiler plate](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) again. [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) means my MVP can have any mix of password, phone number, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, or custom authentication in a dozen clicks. Most things I build need authentication, so that's a huge win.
* Configuring and maintaining a database isn't a reason I build apps. I'd rather pay a little more to have a scalable hosted way to create, read, edit, delete, and query data that would've gone in Postgres. [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) sacrificed a little speed of Firebase's [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) to get [querying](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries) which make Firestore practically as powerful as Postgres. Working in a NoSQL database is a little weird if you're coming from a SQL background but Firebase has an excellent YouTube series on [migrating from SQL to NoSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WacqhiI-g_o) to help out.
* Using React most application logic lives on the client. For the rare bits of code that can't run on the client (like [charging credit cards](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/stripe) or [responding to webhooks](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/minimal-webhook)) [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) make it super easy to deploy functions (way easier than [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)) and have the bonus of responding to database or storage events.
* Managing document storage on Virtual Private Servers is terrible. I moved to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as fast as I could. In the Firebase ecosystem, [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/) integrates way easier and is [about the same price as S3](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html). If you're on a budget and your app stores a lot of documents it might make sense to put in more leg work and store on Backblaze's [B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2).

I'm not terribly worried about being locked in to just using Firebase products. Static hosting and cloud functions are commodities and there are [open source alternatives to Firestore](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-closest-open-source-alternative-to-Firebase-Im-mainly-interested-in-alternatives-to-the-software-framework-I-prefer-a-more-lightweight-solution-that-integrates-well-with-a-Backbone-js-application-and-acts-more-like-a-data-sync-layer). If google decided to charge me [7000% more what they're currently charging](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6bnup0/firebase_costs_increased_by_7000/) I'd have migration options.

Before trying anything below make sure you've [added firebase to your project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup).

## Authentication

Set up an `onAuthStateChanged` listener to respond to a user logging in or out of any authentication type:

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (user) {
    const { displayName, email, emailVerified, photoURL, isAnonymous, uid, providerData } = user;
    window.user = { displayName, email, uid, photoURL };
  } else {
    // User is signed out.
    window.user = null;
  }
});
```

Also set up a `handleAuthError` error handler:

```javascript
const handleAuthError = ({ code, message, provider, email }) => {
  alert(message);
}
```

### Email and Password

To log in with email and password, enable email and password as a login type in [your project's Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) / Auth / Sign in method, then:

```javascript
// create user
firebase.auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).catch(handleAuthError);

// sign in
firebase.auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password).catch(handleAuthError);
```

### Phone

To log in with just a [phone number](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/phone-auth), enable Phone as a login type in [your project's Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) / Auth / Sign in method, then:

```javascript
// set up an invisible recaptcha - not sure why Firebase requires this
const recaptchaVerifier = new firebase.auth.RecaptchaVerifier('id-of-your-sign-in-button', {
  'size': 'invisible'
});

firebase.auth().signInWithPhoneNumber(phoneNumber, recaptchaVerifier).then(confirmationResult => {
  const code = prompt("SMS Sent! Enter the code you just got.");
  confirmationResult.confirm(code);
}).catch(error => {
  // might need to reset the CAPTCHA here?
  console.error(error);
});
```

### Google

To [log in with Google](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/google-signin), enable Google as a log in type in [your project's Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) / Auth / Sign in method, then:

```javascript
const googleProvider = new firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider();
// optionally add a scope: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/googlescopes
// googleProvider.addScope('https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly');

firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(googleProvider).then(result => {
  // optionally store the Google Access Token, if you're doing other stuff with the Google API:
  const token = result.credential.accessToken;
  // `result.user` is also available here, but you should listen for onAuthStateChanged instead
}).catch(handleAuthError);

// you can also `signInWithRedirect` and `getRedirectResult`, but nah
```

### Facebook

To [log in with Facebook](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/facebook-login):

* [create a Facebook app](https://developers.facebook.com/) and get its `App ID` and `App Secret`
* enable Facebook as a log in type in [your project's Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) / Auth / Sign in method and add the `App ID` and `App Secret` from facebook
* add your firebase OAuth redirect URI in [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) / Product Settings / Facebook Login

Then:

```javascript
const facebookProvider = new firebase.auth.FacebookAuthProvider();
// optionally add a scope: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions
// facebookProvider.addScope('user_birthday');

firebase.auth().signInWithPopup(facebookProvider).then(result => {
  // optionally store the Facebook Access Token, if you're doing other stuff with the Facebook API:
  const token = result.credential.accessToken;
  // `result.user` is also available here, but you should listen for onAuthStateChanged instead
}).catch(handleAuthError);

// you can also `signInWithRedirect` and `getRedirectResult`, but nah
```

### Custom Authentication

You can [make up your own way to authenticate users with Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/custom-auth) too, like [magic email login links](https://www.sitepoint.com/lets-kill-the-password-magic-login-links-to-the-rescue/).

First, visit your project's [Service Account](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk) and click "Generate New Private Key".

Then add some authentication logic to your own server (or cloud function) to generate a [custom login token](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/create-custom-tokens):

```javascript
import admin from "firebase-admin";

const serviceAccount = require("path/to/serviceAccountKey.json");

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
  databaseURL: `https://${FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID}.firebaseio.com`
});

// optional additional claims to include in the auth token
const additionalClaims = {
  premiumAccount: true
};

// export a cloud function with custom auth logic
exports.login = functions.https.onRequest((req, res) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;

  if(req.params.password === "correct horse battery staple"){
    admin.auth().createCustomToken(email, additionalClaims).then(token => {
      res.status(200).send({ token });
    }).catch(error => {
      res.status(500).send(error);
    })
  } else {
    res.status(401).send({ error: "wrong password. try https://www.xkcd.com/936/" });
  }
});
```

Finally, use this function to sign in with your client:

```javascript
fetch(authUrl).then(res => res.json()).then(({ token, error }) => {
  if(error) throw error;
  firebase.auth().signInWithCustomToken(token);
}).catch(({code, message}) => {
  alert(message);
});
```

### Sign Out

```javascript
firebase.auth().signOut().then(() => {
  // Sign-out successful.
}).catch(error => {
  alert(error)
});
```
