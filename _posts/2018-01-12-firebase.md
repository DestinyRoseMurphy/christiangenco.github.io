[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is a collection of tools (Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, Hosting, Authentication, Cloud Storage, and related analytics) that make it easier to build apps.

Hosting, [Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/), Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Storage fit particularly well in my [opinionated app making decisions](/react-redux-firestore):

* I can statically deploy apps for free with built in custom domain SSL on [Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/). After configuration, deployments are a simple `$ firebase deploy` and scale at [$0.15/GB transferred](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) with a built in CDN and rollbacks. Fantastic - as long as the bill stays reasonable, I never have to think about the DevOps of hosting my apps again.
* I don't have to run through [OAuth authentication boiler plate](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) again. [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/) means my MVP can have any mix of password, phone number, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Github, or custom authentication in a dozen clicks. Most things I build need authentication, so that's a huge win.
* Configuring and maintaining a database isn't a reason I build apps. I'd rather pay a little more to have a scalable hosted way to create, read, edit, delete, and query data that would've gone in Postgres. [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) sacrificed a little speed of Firebase's [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) to get [querying](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries) which make Firestore practically as powerful as Postgres. Working in a NoSQL database is a little weird if you're coming from a SQL background but Firebase has an excellent YouTube series on [migrating from SQL to NoSQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WacqhiI-g_o) to help out.
* Using React most application logic lives on the client. For the rare bits of code that can't run on the client (like [charging credit cards](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/stripe) or [responding to webhooks](https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/tree/master/minimal-webhook)) [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/) make it super easy to deploy functions (way easier than [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)) and have the bonus of responding to database or storage events.
* Managing document storage on Virtual Private Servers is terrible. I moved to [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as fast as I could. In the Firebase ecosystem, [Cloud Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/) integrates way easier and is [about the same price as S3](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage-pricing.html). If you're on a budget and your app stores a lot of documents it might make sense to put in more leg work and store on Backblaze's [B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2).

I'm not terribly worried about being locked in to just using Firebase products. Static hosting and cloud functions are commodities and there are [open source alternatives to Firestore](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-closest-open-source-alternative-to-Firebase-Im-mainly-interested-in-alternatives-to-the-software-framework-I-prefer-a-more-lightweight-solution-that-integrates-well-with-a-Backbone-js-application-and-acts-more-like-a-data-sync-layer). If google decided to charge me [7000% more what they're currently charging](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/6bnup0/firebase_costs_increased_by_7000/) I'd have [migration options](https://serverless-stack.com/).


## My Guides
