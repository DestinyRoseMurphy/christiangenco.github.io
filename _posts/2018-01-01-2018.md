excerpt: "Goal tracking for 2018"
---

I have three categories of goals for 2018:

1. **Build**: finish 40 week-long project goals
2. **Learn**: publish 12 book outlines, publish 6 course outlines, publish 6 YouTube educational videos
3. **Keep**: stay on top of administrative tasks (like email and my gtd system) and maintain a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, mental health, and relationships)

The numbers above for **Build** and **Learn** weren't picked arbitrarily. There are 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year (about 4 weeks/month), so these goals break down very managably into intermediate monthly goals of:

1. **Build**: 3 week-long project goals per month
2. **Learn**: 1 book outline and either 1 course outline or 1 YouTube educational video published per month

Which in turn break down into managable weekly goals, which will help define clear daily goals.

**Keep** doesn't need to be broken down into monthly or weekly goals. The yearly goals flow directly into daily goals:

3. **Keep**: <20 starred emails daily, inbox 0 (gmail and gtd) daily, exercise daily, meditate daily, meaningfully interact with people daily

To make sure I have the work bandwith to accomplish my 2018 goals, I need to be working for 8 pomodoros (poms) every weekday, or 40 poms every week, or 2,080 poms in 2018. With clear daily goals, each pom will be easy to define.

### Week 01: set 2018 goals ✅, get current on admin work (email, gtd, groove) ✅, publish [outline of *Relationships*](/books/relationships) ❌

1. **2018-01-01**: [gen.co/2018](http://gen.co/2018) (2/2), automate payroll and rent (4/4), inbox 0+gtd (2/2) = 8 ✅
2. **2018-01-02**: automate payroll and rent (1/1), inbox 0+gtd (4/4), Relationships outline (3/3) = 8 ✅

40 - 8 - 8 - 5 - 4 - 6 - 3 - 6 = 0 ✅

Notes: first week doing my fresh new 2018 productivity system and I did 40 poms! Huge success there, even with two unexpected family emergencies that ate up a lot of time. Next week I'd like to go over 40 poms to bank up some time for the 7-day Denver ski trip I'm taking from the 21st to the 28th. Working 8 poms a day, I could bank up 32 extra poms before the trip and only need to squeeze 8 poms over the entire week (~1/day). My "Relationships" outline is two chapters short of publishing, so I'll finish that up next week.

### Week 02: [Apricot Book](https://apricotbook.com) facebook messenger integration ❌, 10 gtd poms that improve my tools ✅, publish [outline of *Relationships*](/books/relationships) ✅

1. **2018-01-08**: Relationships outline (3/3), gtd tools (3/3), Apricot Book (2/2) = 8 ✅
2. **2018-01-09**: gtd tools (2/2), Apricot Book (6/6) = 8 ✅
3. **2018-01-10**: gtd tools (2/2), gtd (3/3), Apricot Book (3/3) = 8 ✅
4. **2018-01-11**: gtd tools (2/2), learn redux (6/6) = 8 ✅
5. **2018-01-12**: learn redux (6/6), gtd tools (1/1), gtd (1/1) = 8 ✅
6. **2018-01-13**: learn redux (6/5), gtd (2/3) = 8 ✅
7. **2018-01-14**: gtd (4/4), firestore blog post (4/4) = 8 ✅

40 + 16 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 - 8 ✅

Notes: Wow - a perfect week. I started this week wanting to push out a feature for an app, but two days in I realized my time would be much better spent going back and learning the fundamentals of the frameworks I wanted to work with: redux and firestore. I pivoted and wrote guides on those technologies instead of building stuff and I think it was a great decision: I have a much better fundamental understanding of what these tools do and how to use them, and I published several guides on them, which satisfies another yearly goal. "Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe." I like the progress I'm making just learning these technologies at a deeper level, so I'll continue that next week and delay the Apricot Book improvement.

### Week 03: Redux and Firebase App Guides, poms.gen.co usable by DR, 10 gtd poms dealing with old laptops and hard drives
