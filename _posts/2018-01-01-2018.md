excerpt: "Goal tracking for 2018"
---

I have three categories of goals for 2018:

1. **Build**: finish 40 week-long project goals
2. **Learn**: publish 12 book outlines, publish 6 course outlines, publish 6 YouTube educational videos
3. **Keep**: stay on top of administrative tasks (like email and my gtd system) and maintain a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, mental health, and relationships)

The numbers above for **Build** and **Learn** weren't picked arbitrarily. There are 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year (about 4 weeks/month), so these goals break down very managably into intermediate monthly goals of:

1. **Build**: 3 week-long project goals per month
2. **Learn**: 1 book outline and either 1 course outline or 1 YouTube educational video published per month

Which in turn break down into managable weekly goals, which will help define clear daily goals.

**Keep** doesn't need to be broken down into monthly or weekly goals. The yearly goals flow directly into daily goals:

3. **Keep**: <20 starred emails daily, inbox 0 (gmail and gtd) daily, exercise daily, meditate daily, meaningfully interact with people daily

To make sure I have the work bandwith to accomplish my 2018 goals, I need to be working for 8 pomodoros (poms) every weekday, or 40 poms every week, or 2,080 poms in 2018. With clear daily goals, each pom will be easy to define.

40 - 8 - 8 - 5 - 4 - 6 - 3 - 6 = 0 ✅

Notes: first week doing my fresh new 2018 productivity system and I did 40 poms! Huge success there, even with two unexpected family emergencies that ate up a lot of time. Next week I'd like to go over 40 poms to bank up some time for the 7-day Denver ski trip I'm taking from the 21st to the 28th. Working 8 poms a day, I could bank up 32 extra poms before the trip and only need to squeeze 8 poms over the entire week (~1/day). My "Relationships" outline is two chapters short of publishing, so I'll finish that up next week.

### Week 02: Apricot Book facebook integration, publish outline of "Relationships", 10 gtd poms that improve my tools

1. 2018-01-08: Relationships outline (0/2), gtd (0/2), Apricot Book (0/4)
