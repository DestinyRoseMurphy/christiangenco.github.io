excerpt: "Goal tracking for 2018"
---

I have three categories of goals for 2018:

1. **Build**: finish 40 week-long project goals
2. **Learn**: publish 12 book outlines, publish 6 course outlines, publish 6 YouTube educational videos
3. **Keep**: stay on top of administrative tasks (like email and my gtd system) and maintain a healthy lifestyle (diet, exercise, mental health, and relationships)

The numbers above weren't picked arbitrarily. There are 52 weeks in a year and 12 months in a year (about 4 weeks/month), so these goals break down very managably into intermediate monthly goals of:

1. **Build**: 3 week-long project goals per month
2. **Learn**: 1 book outline and either 1 course outline or 1 YouTube educational video published per month
3. **Keep**: stay on top of email, gtd, and health

Which in turn break down into managable weekly goals, which will help define clear daily goals.

To make sure I have the work bandwith to accomplish this, I need to be working for 8 pomodoros (poms) every weekday, or 40 poms every week, or 2,080 poms in 2018. With clear daily goals, each pom will be easy to define.
