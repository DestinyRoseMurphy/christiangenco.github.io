I'm working on systemizing how I get things done. This includes things like ranking [my personal projects](/projects) in the best order to finish them, using time more effectively by [working in poms](http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique/), and making it easy for my future lazy self to be productive (even when he doesn't want to).

I'm experimenting with doing consulting work again. It's a nice break from working on my own projects (though they still make most of the money). If you have an interesting project you'd like to work on together, [let me know!](/contact)

To scratch my performing itch, I've been doing improv comedy at the [Dallas Comedy House](http://dallascomedyhouse.com/) - it's my favorite part of stage acting condensed and done over and over. I love it.

<h2>What is this?</h2>

I read [a blog post by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) that talks about his idea to keep track of [what he's doing right now](https://sivers.org/now) on his website:

> It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused. A public declaration of priorities.
> (If I’m doing something that’s not on my list, is it something I want to add, or something I want to stop?)
> It helps me say no, too. When I decline invitations, I point them to [that page](https://sivers.org/now) to let them know it’s not personal.

That sounds like something that could help me!
