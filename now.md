I'm making enough money from passive income to live a comfortable life and save for full financial retirement ([25x my yearly expenses](/your-number)), so I spend a lot of time hunting for enjoyable ways to spend my time and improve my life.

Day to day, this looks like:

* **traveling** and [documenting my trips with Snap Spectacles and DJI drones](https://youtu.be/uRk64UlQtA8?list=PLNev7VcPIItGNy1wRkDd7lsp9UpP1Be8O) (which is a fun exercise in building interesting stories). I especially like traveling to [MicroConf](http://www.microconf.com/), [Bacon Biz](http://baconbiz.com/), and [The World Domination Summit](https://worlddominationsummit.com/) (it's a fun excuse to meet cool people while exploring a new city)
* **rock climbing** outside, which is [a completely different game than in a gym](https://youtu.be/uRk64UlQtA8?list=PLNev7VcPIItGNy1wRkDd7lsp9UpP1Be8O). It's like running in a stuffy warehouse on a tredmil vs. hiking outdoors.
* **biking** instead of driving: default exercise, and a much more fun and mentally stimulating way to get places
* doing **improv comedy** at [The Dallas Comedy House](http://dallascomedyhouse.com/). It's the best parts of stage acting with less time commitment and it never gets boring. I haven't been going recently because traveling and climbing.
* **building stuff**, especially with other people (if you have a cool project, [let me know!](/contact)). Check out [the stuff I'm building right now](/projects).
