I'm working on systemizing how I get things done. This includes things like ranking [my personal projects](/projects) in the best order to finish them, using time more effectively by [working in poms](http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique/), and making it easy for my future lazy self to be productive (even when he doesn't want to).

I'm experimenting with doing consulting work again. It's a nice break from working on my own projects (though they still make most of the money). If you have an interesting project you'd like to work on together, [let me know!](/contact)

To scratch my performing itch, I've been doing improv comedy at the [Dallas Comedy House](http://dallascomedyhouse.com/) - it's my favorite part of stage acting condensed and done over and over. I love it.
