Right now I'm continuing to work on [my own projects](/projects) - mostly [dbinbox](https://dbinbox.com) - and not doing any consulting work. Most of my time is spent [traveling with my wife around the country in our RV tiny house](http://gogo.gen.co), reading, learning, and cobbling together some productive habits in my unstructured lifestyle.

Here's what I'm focused on this month, and what I plan to focus on for the next few months:

<style>td:nth-child(1) {white-space: nowrap;}</style>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Month</th>
      <th>Save</th>
      <th>Book Summary</th>
      <th>Blog Post</th>
      <th>App</th>
      <th>Superpower</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="success">
      <td>2015-11</td>
      <td>$X</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>christian.gen.co (this website), <a href="https://profileflags.parseapp.com/">Profile Flags</a></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="success">
      <td>2015-12</td>
      <td>$X</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="success">
      <td>2016-01</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td>[MCT oil vs. Coconut Oil for Ketogenic Diets](/mct)</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="active ">
      <td>2016-02</td>
      <td>$X</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="">
      <td>2016-03</td>
      <td>$X</td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
      <td></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

All the [book summaries](/books) and [blog posts](/posts) I've written are on this website. You can check out all of the apps I've made, and want to eventually make, on [my projects page](/projects).

<h2>What is this?</h2>

I read [a blog post by Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff) that talks about his idea to keep track of [what he's doing right now](https://sivers.org/now) on his website:

> It’s a nice reminder for myself, when I’m feeling unfocused. A public declaration of priorities.
> (If I’m doing something that’s not on my list, is it something I want to add, or something I want to stop?)
> It helps me say no, too. When I decline invitations, I point them to [that page](https://sivers.org/now) to let them know it’s not personal.

That sounds like something that could help me!
