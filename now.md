I'm making enough money from passive income to live a comfortable life and save for full financial retirement ([25x my yearly expenses](/your-number)), so my time is spent focused on improving my life satisfaction and effectiveness.

Day to day, this looks like:

* **building stuff**: I set up [meticulous tracking for ambitious goals for 2018](/2018) to ensure I effectively allocate time to the highest return on investment activity I do (both in money and satisfaction), which is making [useful things](/projects). If you have a cool project you'd like to work on together, [I'd love to talk to you!](/contact)
* **biking**: my bicycle is [one of my most useful things](/things). I use it way more a car, and it's a great way to stay physically active by default. If you don't bike, [you need to](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/07/what-do-you-mean-you-dont-have-a-bike/).
* **traveling**: in my [review of 2017](/2017-review), one of my consistently rewarding activities was traveling to new places. I especially enjoy going with friends, doing physical things there, like [rock climbing](https://youtu.be/uRk64UlQtA8?list=PLNev7VcPIItGNy1wRkDd7lsp9UpP1Be8O), and [documenting my trips]((https://youtu.be/uRk64UlQtA8?list=PLNev7VcPIItGNy1wRkDd7lsp9UpP1Be8O))
* **performing**: I love giving talks and doing improv comedy at [The Dallas Comedy House](http://dallascomedyhouse.com/) (both among my [highlights of 2017](/2017-review)).
