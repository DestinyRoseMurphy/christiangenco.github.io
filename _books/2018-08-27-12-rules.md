## ☯️ Overature

Humans need to walk a fine line between order ("yang", certainty, totalitarianism, authoritarianism, habit, tradition, tribalism, goals) and chaos ("yin", freedom, challenge, surprise, novelty, uncertainty, pain, anxiety, nihilism, meaninglessness) to live properly and flourish.

## 1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back

<figure class="right"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SUmMzWE.jpg" /><figcaption>My mnemonic for remembering that rule 1 (Januarry - the ball drop) is to strut like the top lobster</figcaption></figure>

Evolutionarily, status can prevent fights (nobody wants to fight if they know they'll lose), so status is hard-wired super far back with serotonin (high serotonin = high status) and (in lobsters) octopamine (high octopanine = low status).

Low status means more impulsive behavior, more danger, worse resources, low community aid, bad mating options, getting sick, and slouching.

High status means long term planning, comfort, safety, the best resources, lots of community wanting to do favors for you, the best prime ass, and strutting.

Status manifests in populations as [the Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), or Price's law: distribution is unequally distributed to those of high status.

[Pareto Distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution#Applications) probably aren't a human construct - they describe size distributions of sand particles, hard drive error rates, mass distributions of stars, and distributions of sizes of human settlements.

Your status is dictated by your environment, but you can also shape your environment! Increase your body's perception of its status by waking up at the same time every day ("at approximately the same time a typical person wakes up"), eat a fat and protein heavy breakfast, and fight against oppression with a firm, certain, and constant "no!"

This behavior will trigger a positive feedback loop of serotonin.

## 2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping

Humans are better at taking care of their pets than of themselves because they don't think themselves worthy of care: you can see better than anyone else how worthy you are of comtempt! How flawed you are! Why should anyone help you?

Male/Female and order/chaos are deeply rooted stories inately social humans use to personify (and therefore understand through a model) the world. Seek flow, balance, and meaning by having one foot in order (routine, security) and the other in novelty (creativity, challenge).

Being good doesn't mean being *nice*; relationships are stronger when both parties are strong, self-interested, and honest about what they want.

Humans are deeply flawed, but they can still hold the world together, and for that they deserve respect.

> What career would challenge me and render me productive and helpful so that I could shoulder my share of the load, and enjoy the consequences? What can I be doing to improve my health, expand my knowledge, and strengthen my body?

Decide where you're going. That decision will give you meaning, direction, and purpose. That meaning - a "why" - could justify any obstacle of your miserable existance - the "hows".

> He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.

> -- Friedrich Nietzsche

## 3. Make Friends with people who want the best for you

It's easy to get drug down in toxic relationships trying to save another person and delude yourself with the narrative of being a selfless (and therefore "good") person.

You can't help people that don't actually want to be helped, and they'll drag you down if you start succeeding, because your success makes them look bad.

It's harder and better for both parties to seek relationships that support eachother's improvements. Don't have friendships you wouldn't recommend to your sister.

## 4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today

<figure class="left"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bVFleZP.jpg" /><figcaption>My mnemonic for remembering that rule 4 (April - shower) is to compare yourself with who you were yesterday</figcaption></figure>

It's "a cheap trick of the rational mind" to degrade yourself and your efforts as being meaningless (compared to the best people in the world, or the age of the universe).

Instead, find meaning in playing the games you enjoy getting better at (choose your own hierarchy!). Judge your success on growth across all of your games.

To stay motivated, entice yourself with [temptation bundling](https://jamesclear.com/temptation-bundling) fairly. Don't be a tyrant to yourself: fairly and compassionately negotiate without judgement of what you *really* want (not just what you think you *should* want). Yes, the things you must do to better your life are hard and boring - what would you like as a fair reward?

> You're a bad employee, but a worse boss

Evolution has crafted you to aim for goals.

## 5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them

<figure class="right"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/o79XElR.jpg" /><figcaption>My mnemonic for remembering that rule 5 (May - mayfly) is to </figcaption></figure>

Parents try to be liked by their children instead of enforcing the discipline that would make a child less shitty and better able to be valuable in society.

Discipline your children lest they are disciplined by the less caring world. Do this with minimal necessary rules and force for effectiveness.

> A parent can defeat a two-year old. Old age and treachery can always overcome youth and skill.

Reward someone for doing what you are trying to get them to do: "no grudge after victory." Also **never** punish someone for doing something good unless you're trying to torture them (ex: carrying wet bags of salt back and forth in Auschwitz).

Anger is probably a common reason children cry.

The job of parenting isn't to shelter - it's to maximize learning and minimize cost.
