## 1. Post-Romanticism

Here's the script Western culture in 2017 gives you for how love is supposed to work:

* True love means loving every part of the one right person over all other people. If there's something you don't like about your partner - if they need to change - it's a sign they're not the right person.
* The right partner is your "soulmate, best friend, co-parent, co-chauffeur, accountant, household manager and spiritual guide"
* Finding the right parter is all about following your feelings (and therefore marrying for pragmatic reasons is heartless and terrible). You'll inately know when you've found the right person without instruction.
* Long-term marriage is the goal of love
* Sex is the supreme expression of love (and therefore infrequent sex and adultery are love catastrophies). When you've found your soul mate, sex is great forever (even with kids and work), and you should never be attracted to anyone else.
* The right partner intuitively understands you without trying.
* Relationships driven by practicalities (like having similar bathroom etiquette) or money are sinister ("gold-digger", "social climber")

This is how love works in every movie you've ever seen, and every book you've ever read.

**This script is arbitrary, relatively new, and a bad formula for relationships.**

Romanticism sets unrealistic expectations and sets lovers up for disaster. You'll need to rethink cultural assumptions - what you've been set up to think of as "normal love" - and work to succeed.

The Classical model, this book proposes, is better. Classical love has the attitudes that:

* love and sex aren't necessarily coupled
* discussing money and practicalities is necessary for long term relationship success
* everyone is flawed, and you'll never find everything you want in a single person
* understanding another person requires immense and stilted effort

## 2. Object Choice

Romanticism would say humans choose who to fall in love with based on an inate sense that guides us to a partner that's perfect for us. Humans probably fall in love with people that love them in **familiar ways** - the ways their parents cared for them as children - which isn't necessarily correct or positive (as all heuristics are).

Humans may have negative patterns of what they think they want from a partner that were created when they were too young to understand them.

It's important to understand what you currently think you want from a partner, and then critically analyze if they're valid. It can be hard not to positively spin the things you want, especially if you think they're negative, so finishing these sentence fragments may help:

* If I tell a partner how much I need them, they will...
* When someone tells me they really need me, I...
* If someone can't cope, I...
* When someone tells me to get my act together, I...
* If I were to be frank about my anxieties...
* If my partner told me not to worry, I'd...
* When someone blames me unfairly, I...

Even if you don't deconstruct the "type" you have in your head, it can be useful to know the qualities you're looking for and explore why you might like those qualities.

## 3. Transference

Humans tend to emotionally overreact to things they were sensitive to as a child (when they were too vulnerable or immature to properly cope). The human unconscious doesn't adapt to new information unless it's forced ("rational disentanglement").

How can you figure out what you're emotionally sensitive too? Subconscious "transference exercises":

* Rorschach Tests
* Completing sentence stems ("Men in authority are generally...", "Young women are almost always...")
* Henry Murray and Christiana Morgan's indeterminate drawing tests

## 4. The Problem of Closeness

Humans have a fear of rejection that they hide with distance or control to try to balance a perceived power imbalance ("I love you which makes me vulnerable to be hurt by you if you leave, so I'm leaving! You can't hurt me way over here!"). Both partners of a relationship revealing their weaknesses by admitting their emotional investment (instead of making preemptive strikes guarding against being hurt) and offering assurances freely makes a much stronger relationship.

Triggers to insecurities can be small and silly (being late, talking curtly), but have huge effects, especially in long established relationships where the hurt partner feels it would be silly to ask for proof they are still wanted.

Distance, or avoidance, isn't necessarily physical. You can say you're busy, avoid getting close, or even have a secret affair (the ultimate proof that you don't need your partner's love).

Control manifests as pinning your partner down administratively, like getting on someone for being late or not doing chores (instead of admitting you're worried it doesn't matter to them).

Insecurity in love is a sign of well-being. Show you're invested enough to care.

## 5. The Weakness of Strength

Every weakness is derived from a strength. Having the strength of being relaxed means you have the weakness of not springing to action.

Humans with only strengths categorically can't exist.

## 6. Partner-As-Child

When babies make mistakes, you don't get upset at them: you try to understand why they made the mistake, and lovingly help them to do better next time.

So why get angry at adult mistakes? Human adulthood and childhood are arbitrary lines anyway.

Nurture your partner's inner child, even though sympathy comes easier to a literal cute baby.

## 7. Loving and Being Loved

As a child, you only really learned how to *be* loved, and so you expect and want unconditional unreciprocated from your partner now. As an adult, to get love, you need to learn to give love.

The love a parent has for a child is unsustainable. Parents hide their moments of rage, despair, and indifference and don't expect children to ask how their day was.

It's not uncommon for a couple to seem like two small children who have been left alone in the nursery and are both wailing that they have been ignored, neither of them able to step into the adult role for long enough to build up the other and see their efforts returned.

## 8. The Dignity of Ironing

Domestic details aren't prestigeous, but are packed with emotional significance (though you wouldn't know that reading Romantic writers). The practicalities of living together don't make for very exciting narrative arcs, but they've very important in real-world relationships.

## 9. Teaching and Learning

Don't be insulted by your partner suggesting change. No one is perfect, so you can't get closer to your ideal self if you meet change with resentment.

Loving someone doesn't mean accepting and loving every part of them - it's normal to only like most of someone. Be careful to present suggestions for improvement in a palitable package: it's easy to sound like you're complaining or insulting instead of teaching.

Likewise, be open to your partner's suggestions for improvement (even if clumsily communicated). Your partner suggesting change for you is one of the highest benefits of love. Who else is close enough to you to notice subtle ways you can improve yourself? Who else do you trust more to give you useful information?

Love should be a nurturing attempt by two people to reach their full potential.

## 10. Pessimism

Problem-free relationships don't exist. We are all, in diverse ways, damaged and insane. The only people you think are normal are ones you don't know very well yet, though "normal" relationships are how you set expectations for your own.

High expectations set you up to be disappointed and frustrated. The grass always looks greener when you haven't discovered the downsides of the other grass yet.

Your picture of a perfect relationship probably looks like:

> A descent partner should easily, intuitively, understand what I'm concerned about. I shouldn't have to explain things at length to them. If I've had a difficult day, I shouldn't have to say that I'm worn out and need a bit of space. They should be able to tell how I'm feeling. They shouldn't oppose me: if I point out that one of our acquaintances is a bit stuck up, they shouldn't start defending them. They're meant to be constantly supportive. When I feel bad about myself, they should shore me up and remind me of my strengths. A decent partner won't make too many demands. They won't be constantly requesting that I do things to help them out, or dragging me off to do something I don't really like. We'll always like the same things. I tend to have pretty good taste in films, food and house-hold routines: they'll understand and sympathise with them at once.

When disappointed that these expectations don't live up to reality, we get mad, disappointed, and frustrated. Instead of blaming overly high expectations, we believe we picked the wrong person:

> It wouldn't be like this with another person, the one we saw at the conference. They looked nice and we had a brief chat about the theme of the keynote speaker. Partly because of the slope of their neck and a lilt in their accent, we reached an overwhelming conclusion: with them it would be easier. **There could be a better life waiting round the corner.**

(more about crushes in chapter 15)

A healthier philosophy is one of **pessimism**. Assume your partner won't understand you very well, and you won't understand them. The few ways you do understand eachother will be exceptions to be celebrated, and a more comprehensive understanding will need to be demandingly worked towards. Disagreements should be celebrated as learning more about someone close up across the full range of their life.

Dealing with other people is hard and complicated; long term relationships work differently than honeymoon periods. Understanding other people are entities separate from us is something we have to learn (babies think their mothers are an extension of themselves and get frustrated when their needs aren't intuited).

## 11. Blame and Love

Humans blame their partners for things the world does to them because their partner has taken the place of their parents, and they know their partner will tolerate it.

Your partner being responsible for everything that happens to you is blatently irrational, but it's an easy trap to fall into when looking for someone to blame. Most of the time there isn't anyone to blame: bad things happen with no malicious actor (["Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor)), so you blame the person you know you can use as a punching bag.

This is an echo of how you used to think of your parents: somehow everything, good or bad, that happened to you as a child was caused by your parents. If there was an unjustice in the world, throwing a big enough fit to your parents could fix the problem with a wave of their gigantic omnipotent fingers.

This is, of course, not a fair thing to do to your partner. It's not their fault you're late for your flight - being late is a thing that has happened, and you can now work together to come to solve the present situation.

If you find your partner getting angry at you, be flattered that they've attributed this much power and closeness to you. To them, you've become the person that loves them as only their parents could have.

## 12. Politeness and Secrets

Sometimes it's more polite and wise to not be completely honest.

Romanticism teaches that if two people truly love one another, they must always tell each other the truth about everything.

In reality, editing raw brutal truths can be kinder and counterintuitively foster stronger relationships.

## 13. Explaining One's Madness

People are complicated and don't make sense, so you should expect a strong relationship to be coupled with a lot of explaining. Strangeness from a life of traumas, excitements, fears, influences, opportunities, misfortunes, talents, and weaknesses isn't something to hide or suppress, but to be laid out and explained.

Everyone has shitty qualities. Accept people as lovable fools instead of irritating idiots and everyone will have a better time.

> In a more enlightened society than ours, one of the first questions that partners would be expected to ask one another...would simply be: "And how are you bad?"

## 14. Artificial Conversations

More structured talks can reveal more truth than natural ones. Romanticism teaches that if you can just find the right person you'll finally be understood. Understanding another human takes a lot of work and commitment to trying to explain yourself, and trying to understand.

Try these artificial (but useful) conversation starters:

* What would you most like to be complimented on in the relationship?
* Where do you think you're especially good as a person?
* Which of your flaws do you want to be treated more generously?
* What would you tell your younger self about love?
* What do you think I get wrong about you?
* What is one incident you'd like me to apologise for?
* Can I ask you to apologise for an incident too?
* How have I let you down?
* What would you want to change about me?
* If I was magically offered a chance to change something about you, what do you guess it would be?
* If you could write an instruction manual for yourself in bed, what would you put in it?

and these sentence stems:

* I resent...
* I am puzzled by...
* I am hurt by...
* I regret...
* I am afraid that...
* I am frustrated by...
* I am happier when...
* I want...
* I appreciate...
* I hope...
* I would so like you to understand...
* When I am anxious in our relationship, I tend to...
* You tend to respond by..., which makes me...
* When we argue, on the surface I show..., but inside I feel...
* The more I..., the more you..., and then the more I...

Getting close to someone can be awkward and uncomfortable, so decide before you start that that's going to be okay.

## 15. Crushes

Humand tend to fill in the gaps and assume an attractive person is perfect, but there's no such thing. The grass is always greener. Notice what you like about your crushes to gain insight into what you're missing.

The idea that you could bump into a person that's perfect for you, like most harmful and incorrect ideas discussed in this book, comes from Romanticism: the "love at first sight" trope.

Humans evolved to make quick decisions about things and other humans on limited information. These snap judgements are sometimes useful, but always an inaccurate approximation. You can't possibly know anything about them that's not visually apparant.

That beautiful stranger on the sidewalk isn't a complete answer to everything wrong in your life, because that's impossible: everyone has something very substantially wrong with them. They're just very pretty.

> How can one be so sure [that everyone is flawed]? Because the facts of life have deformed all of our natures. No one among us has come through unscathed. There is too much to fear: mortality, loss, dependency, abandonment, ruin, humiliation, subjection. We are, all of us, desperately fragile, ill-equipped to meet with the challenges to our mental integrity: we lack courage, preparation, confidence, intelligence...we were (necessarily) imperfectly parented...The chances of a perfectly good human emerging from the perilous facts of life are non-existent.

Crushes probably aren't worth persuing, but are useful for teaching us about the qualities we admire and need more of in our lives.

## 16. Sexual Non-Liberation

True sexual liberation hasn't happened yet. There are still truths in sexuality thatare uncomfortable to jive with contemporary "normalcy".

Romanticism teaches that we're in sexually enlightened times compared to people of the past: that people thought their hands would fall off if they masturbated, that Victorian prudes could be burned in a vat of oil for ogling someone's ankle, and that everyone was clueless in the bedroom. Americans invented bikinis, porn, and Tindr and now nobody has sexual hangups anymore! Sex came to be perceived as useful refreshing exercise (like tennis).

In reality, people are still really hung up on sex, and ashamed to explore what they want. Here are some unpalatable realities:

* it's rare to maintain sexual interest in only one person
* it's possible to love someone and want to have sex with strangers
* a human can be well adjusted and a functional and productive member of society, and also have degrading sexual habits
* it's normal to have bisexual and incestuous fantasies, among countless other taboos
* it may be easier to be excited by someone you don't like than someone you love

This is all super normal, and you should talk more about it with people.

## 17. The Loyalist and the Libertine

Both pure fidelity and pure infidelity are naive and incomplete. The ideal solution includes an understanding of both.

Currently, there are two tropes of people in monogamy:

* The Loyalist (romantic): love is intimately tied to sex, so it's impossible to love someone and want to have sex with someone else. Sex isn't like tennis, it's tied with a deep emotional connection you can't decouple.
* The Libertine (anti-romantic): sex and love are completely decoupled. There are much worse ways of betraying a person than sleeping with a third party, like ignoring your partner

Both of these are kinda right, and kinda catastrophic. Monogamy really is at times maddening and suffocating, and a functioning relationship is hard to build treating sex partners as tennis partners. The right answer is probably somewhere between them:

> Marry, and you will regret it; don't marry, you will also regret it; marry or don't marry, you will regret it either way...whether you hang yourself or do not hang yourself, you will regret both. This, gentlemen, is the essence of all philosophy - Soren kierkegaard

If you choose pure fidelity, couple it with celebration at the stoic generosity of two partners managing not to sleep around or kill each other.

## 18. Celibacy and Endings

Romanticizing long-term relationships is a fallacy; a series of short ones can be just as good (or better).

Romanticism discredits celibacy (willingly foregoing a long-term love relationship), but there are a lot of personality traits that might make long term relationships unideal: loving demanding work (like St Hilda of Whitby), hating children, enjoying solitude, or liking to express oneself sexually outside of a loving union.
