Here are the projects I'm working on next, in order:

* Broccoli Phone: let customers send SMS messages to your business number

* business handbook: keep all of your business operations in one place so your office doesn't explode when someone gets sick
* 3d rings: create your own 3D-printed wedding band in silver, gold, or platinum
* Personal CRM: keep track of everyone you know, get reminded when you haven't talked to interesting friends in a while, and get a good tl;dr of a friend's life before you talk to them again so you can ask relevant questions
* beats for iOS: the iOS Clock app in [internet time](http://www.wnyc.org/story/15-internet-time/)
* Weasley Clock: mobile app to log my location and show it [like in Harry Potter](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Weasley_Clock)
* a better [Markdown to MLA](http://markdowntomla.com/) that works more like Google Docs (ex: lets you save documents and document versions, send papers to other people for feedback and to see their changes)
* fileinbox: DBinbox for SalesForce. Receive files from clients in a secure file upload portal.
* offstage club: make it as easy to see a local theatre show as it is to see a movie
* whiteboard js: a web app that makes it easy to make Khan Academy-style drawings
* Urgent Practice: practice management software for small medical offices.
* tabletop js: play any board game with anyone on the internet in real time. No rules are enforced, so you can play any game (and even cheat or (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻)
* foft: mobile app to measure how tall a building is based on how long it takes for a pebble to drop to the ground
