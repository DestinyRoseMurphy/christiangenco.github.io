Here's a list of things I've made that you can use:

* [dbinbox](https://dbinbox.com): receive large files on your website
* [textbooks please](http://textbooksplease.com): textbook search engine
* [Export History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-history/hcohnnbbiggngobheobhdipbgmcbelhh?hl=en-US): Chrome plugin to export your history
* [Profile Flags](https://profileflags.parseapp.com/): add a country flag over your Facebook profile picture
* [autorunner](https://github.com/christiangenco/autorunner): command line tool to run a command when a file is saved
* [Markdown to MLA](http://markdowntomla.com/) and [Markdown to APA](http://markdowntoapa.com/): generate perfect MLA and APA documents from plain text markdown
* [t_time_tracker](https://github.com/christiangenco/t_time_tracker): simple command line time tracking

Here are some things I'd eventually like to make:

* S3 filesystem/archive
* f(t): Apple Watch/iOS timer for calculating things like how tall your building is based on how long it takes a pebble to fall to the ground
* 3D wedding band generator
* a better Mailchimp with tight Rails and Meteor integration
* a better Google Voice for businesses
* a timesheet you can clock in/out of with an app/sms
* make it easy for users to convert excel documents to strict json
* financial retirement tracker
* [markdown to mla](http://markdowntomla.com) native app
* native mac file tools (pdf merge, image resize, geotag strip, image flip from iOS bug)
* "Launching Rails" info product
