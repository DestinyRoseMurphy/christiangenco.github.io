These are things I've made that make money.

* [dbinbox](https://dbinbox.com): receive large files on your website
* [textbooks please](http://textbooksplease.com): textbook search engine
* [Dr. Dog](https://www.alexaskillstore.com/Dr-Dog/39678): ask your Amazon Echo if it's safe for your dog to eat certain foods
* [Export History](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/export-history/hcohnnbbiggngobheobhdipbgmcbelhh?hl=en-US): Chrome plugin to export your history

## Experiments

* [DnDice](https://gen.co/dndice): Dungeons and Dragons dice roller
* [qgen](https://gen.co/qgen/): query generator for hunting for 30x500 audiences
* [PastCam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pastcam/id1217068871?mt=8): iOS app to take "then and now" style pictures
* [QR reader/writer](https://gen.co/qr/): it's pretty easy to make a malicious QR code reader, so I made my own. Works offline, like on an air gapped computer.
* [Secrets](http://christian.gen.co/secrets/): split up a secret into N pieces so you can recover it with any M of the pieces
* [Mosaic Web Dev](http://mosaic.apps.gen.co): a platform for hosting lessons that students can go through at their own pace. A solution to teaching technical summer camps where half the class got left behind and half the class felt bored (and my voice got tired).

* [Markdown to MLA](http://markdowntomla.com/) and [Markdown to APA](http://markdowntoapa.com/): generate perfect MLA and APA documents from plain text markdown
* [Timecard App](https://timecardapp.com): timecard calculator ([a rewrite of my oldest useful program](/timecardapp))
* [Timer](http://gen.co/timer/): a simple timer with alarm for teaching in poms
* [Icon Dice](http://gen.co/icondice/): a ~900 sided dice with [icons](https://material.io/icons/) instead of numbers
* [Clear Decoder](http://gen.co/clear/): decode links from the [Clear iOS list making app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clear-todos/id493136154?mt=8) to markdown
* [Profile Flags](https://profileflags.parseapp.com/): add a country flag over your Facebook profile picture
* [autorunner](https://github.com/christiangenco/autorunner): command line tool to run a command when a file is saved
* [t_time_tracker](https://github.com/christiangenco/t_time_tracker): simple command line time tracking
* [Email Tip Bot](http://emailtipbot.com): send/receive bitcoin through email. Shut down (and coins returned) in 2017.
